Classifies the main job employment status of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise.  
Paid employee includes anyone whose basic remuneration is not directly dependent on the revenue of the unit they work for, typically remunerated by wages and salaries but may be paid for piece work or in-kind. The `continuous' criteria used in the ILO definition is not used here as data are often absent and due to country specificity. 
Non paid employee includes contributing family workers are those workers who hold a self-employment job in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same households who cannot be regarded as a partner because of their degree of commitment to the operation of the establishment, in terms of working time or other factors, is not at a level comparable to that of the head of the establishment. 
Employer is a business owner (whether alone or in partnership) with employees. If the only people working in the business are the owner and `contributing family workers, the person is not considered an employer (as has no employees) and is, instead classified as own account. 
Own account or self-employment includes jobs are those where remuneration is directly dependent from the goods and service produced (where home consumption is considered to be part of the profits) and have not engaged any permanent employees to work for them on a continuous basis during the reference period. 
Members of producers' cooperatives are workers who hold a self-employment job in a cooperative producing goods and services in which each member takes part on an equal footing with other members in determining the organization of production, sales and/or other work of the establishment, the investments and the distribution of the proceeds of the establishment amongst the members.
