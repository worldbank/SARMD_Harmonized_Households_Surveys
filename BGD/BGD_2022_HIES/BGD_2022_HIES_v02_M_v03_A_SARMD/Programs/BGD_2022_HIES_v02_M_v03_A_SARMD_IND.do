Paid employee includes anyone whose basic remuneration is not directly dependent on the revenue of the unit they work for, typically remunerated by wages and salaries but may be paid for piece work or in-kind.

Non paid employee includes contributing family workers are those workers who hold a self-employment job in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same households who cannot be regarded as a partner because of their degree of commitment to the operation of the establishment, in terms of working time or other factors, is not at a level comparable to that of the head of the establishment.
